# Eternalblue-WINDOW7
EternalBlue is a major vulnerability in microsoft`s server message block(SMB) protocol.
 The vulnerability affects older version of windows,including windows XP, windows 7 and windows sever 2008
I exploited Window 7(Eternalblue vulnerabilities) in metasploitable 

I used metasploit to exploit the vulnerabilities in window 7 using the following steps;
 I used the ipconfig command to get the IP address of the vulnerable machine ( window 7)
 used Nmap to check the open ports(Vulnerability)
Gathered reconnaissance on the vulnerability using the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures(CVE) list and firefox to know it there are other known vulnerabilities.
 I launched and  ran a vulnerability scan on metasploit
i used an auxiliary scanner first  to gather more information on (Eternalblue) vulnerability
 Then i used the exploit command to check if it is vulnerable or not 
 Set the target IP address( window 7)
 interacted with the session with the “screenshot” command


 I hope you have learnt as much as I did
